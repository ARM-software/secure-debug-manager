SDC-600 debugger libraries and example
======================================

:warning: This branch is archived and no longer maintained.

The Arm CoreSight [SDC-600 Secure Debug Channel](https://developer.arm.com/ip-products/system-ip/coresight-debug-and-trace/coresight-components/coresight-sdc-600-secure-debug-channel), provides a dedicated path to a debugged system for authenticating debug accesses.

The SDC-600 debugger libraries and examples project contains:
* Debugger-side libraries
    * Secure Debug Manager
    * Authentication Token Provider
    * External COM Port driver
    * CSAPBCOM CoreSight interface
* Example application
* [Documentation](https://arm-software.github.io/sdc600-debugger/index.html)

Requirements
------------
* CMake v3.1 or greater.
* RDDI header files and redistributable libraries. These are available in your Arm Development Studio install directory (`<Install Directory>/sw/debugger/RDDI/`).
    * Copy header files to `<this repository>/include/`
    * Copy Redistributable and development libraries to `<this repository>/depends/<platform>/`
        * See individual README.txt located in `<this repository>/depends/<platform>/` for further details.
* [Googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest) project cloned alongside this repository. Only required if you are building tests.
* Configure build option definitions in source:
    * `libs/secure_debug_manager/secure_debug_manager.cpp`
        * `BYPASS_SDM_END` - Whether calls to SDM_End are bypassed and immediately return without error. Useful if the Secure Debug Handler does not implement the link release flags sent by SDM_End. Default: false.
    * `libs/ext_com_port/ext_com_port_driver.cpp`
        * `COM_PORT_HW_TX_BLOCKING` - Whether the External COM Port Driver uses hardware blocking by sending data via the COM port Data Blocking Register (DBR), rather than the non-blocking Data Register (DR) while checking the Status Register (SR) for the TX FIFO status. Useful if the debug vehicle is not capable of long hardware blocking periods, however disabling this will have a performance impact. Default: true.

An example directory structure on Linux looks like:

	/
	|- .
	|- ..
	|- sdc600-debugger (this repository)/
		|- depends/
			|- linux-x86_64/
				|- librddi-debug-rvi.so.2
			|- ...
		|- example/
		|- include/
			|- rddi.h
			|- ...
		|- libs/
	|- googletest/
Windows follows a similar structure albeit with a different naming scheme to match the operating system naming convention.

Build (Windows)
--------------
!! Run the following commands inside a Visual Studio command prompt !!
!! Visual Studio 2013 or greater required !!
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G <generator> ..
msbuild /p:Configuration=Release INSTALL.vcxproj
```
`<generator>` can be any available CMake generator. Run `cmake -G` to list all available generators.
Example: `cmake -G "Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64"`

Build (Linux)
------------
```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ make install
```
Build with tests - requires [Googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest)
----------------------------------------
Add the following definitions to the CMake command: `-DBUILD_TESTS=1 -DGOOGLETEST_ROOT=../googletest`

Running the example
-------------------
The example is a simple command line application that calls the SDC-600 debugger libraries to trigger the authentication process for a specified platform. The ``output/`` directory will contain the built example along with the necessary libraries and dependencies.

The example can be run with the following options:
```
$ debugger_example(.exe) <DSTREAM_ADDRESS> <SDF_PATH> <RESET_TYPE> <AP_INDEX>

	DSTREAM_ADDRESS : Address of debug vehicle, prefixed with protocol (TCP:/USB:).
	SDF_PATHFILE : Path to an SDF file describing the target system
	RESET_TYPE :
	    -1 : No reset.
	    0  : SDC-600 COM port reset.
	    >0 : nSRST. Perform system reset via the DAP. Value should be the RDDI device index (index within SDF file) of the system DAP.
	AP_INDEX : RDDI device index (index within SDF file) of the COM-AP or APBCOM device.
```

For example using the MPS3 platform in example/data:
`$ ./debugger_example TCP:<DSTREAM-ADDRESS> example/data/an535_sdc600.sdf 1 29`

:information_source: Note: If connecting to the debug vehicle via USB, additional tools are needed from the Arm Development Studio install directory. Add the following to your PATH environment variable before running the example: `<Install Directory>/sw/debughw/tools2/`.

Arm Development Studio integration
----------------------------------
The ``arm_ds/`` directory contains a manifest.xml file along with the built libraries. The manifest file is used by Arm DS to load the SDC-600 debugger libraries for debug connections. The provided ``manifest.xml`` is for the reference library implementations in this package. The schema for the manifest file is described in ``sdm_manifest.xsd``.
